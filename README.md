# Tetris v2
This is my second attempt at creating a game of tetris, and I am very happy with the results!
So here is what's changed:

## Bug fixes:
* Clearing lines behavior is no longer wrong
* Rotation related bugs have been fixed

## Code improvements and features:
* Colors added
* Hard drop readded
* Code is much cleaner than in v1
* OOP has been better implemented

Note: all of my comments have a '?' in the beggining.
That's because I use the Better Comments extension for VS Code, which makes those comments blue in my IDE
